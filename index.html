					<h2>New features</h2>
					<p>The new Active Touch System fundamentally changes the way you receive and strike the ball, providing closer control, improved fluidity, more creativity and increased player personality. Utilize a suite of new first touch tools, like the disguised trap, flick-up volleys, or even skill-specific animations, like the Neymar Trap, to beat your opponent and create scoring opportunities.</p>
					<p>A re-imagined system gives players the tools to set multiple tactical approaches, offering in-depth customization pre-match, as well as more options for dynamic in-match adjustments simply from the D-Pad. Each tactical approach combines formations, mentalities, and both attacking and defensive play styles, enabling you to easily customize your play to any situation.</p>
					<p>Whether it's a hit from outside the box, a precision header, or a deft touch, timed finishing adds a new layer of control to your chances in front of goal.</p>
					<p>With 50/50 Battles, user reactions and player attributes determine the outcome for winning loose balls across the pitch. With increased teammate intelligence and spatial awareness, every challenge matters in the fight for possession.</p>
					<p>The game-changing animation system, which brought player personality and increased fidelity in movement to EA SPORTS FIFA, returns with increased coverage across the pitch. Enhanced animations for tactical shielding, impact balancing, and physical jostles bring realistic player movement, responsiveness and personality to new heights.</p>
