				<h4>Pro Clubs</h4>
				<p><img class="foto_article" src="img/Welcome_to_pro_club.jpg" style="float:left"></img>This is mode, who fascinated me the most. Players who spend the most time with this mode, don`t need much. Just to be aple to good spend time with friends. However, EA Sports, according to many players, also me, focused too much on earning money in the Ultimate Team and neglected the rest of the modes. In "The Career", "The Journey" and "Ultimate Team" we playing someone else. The only and non-repeatable mode in with we create our character is Pro Clubs. In any time we can change gameface, position, height and shoes. <img class="foto_article" src="img/Polska_Panda.jpg" style="float:right"></img> Many veteran players attached to their own characters, they don`t change characteristic elements. I`m been forever Polska Panda with afro. For three year i make this same characters. Since I remember, choosing Pro Clubs we are greeted with the same window Create-Grow-Join-Win. Seemingly easy to navigate, often losing new players for whom the first impression is the most important. A tip for new, when you want experience new friendship, new adventures and thrills. There are multilingual Leagues related to the game, but they do not cooperate with EA. You can find them on the internet, on facebook. Just look. <img class="foto_article" src="img/Overall.jpg" style="float:left"></img>  Pro Clubs isn`t about playing alone, if you do that, you only waste time. The Game begins, when the eleven players are fighting with clubs with the same amount. In this case first impression is always mistake. In every games, you have summary progress, get rating and development points to develop the overall. At first, we playing poorly developed characters, we may be feel badly, but with time our overall growing and we can feel like Messi or Ronaldo. Overall grow with 79 to 95. When you playing about half years, you can have power full characters. I can assure you there is a difference, between 79 and 95 Overall.<img class="foto_article" src="img/Kit,Badge.jpg" style="float:right"></img> In Fifa 17 EA Sports added new options, we can create new logo and kits. This is something kind of development. However, I`m 
				disappointed. I fell in love with this game since the first adventure with fifa 10. In eight years nothing isn`t changed in game. Players have caused this game to be worth attention, they created a league for themselves in which they play clubs versus clubs season, emerging from the winner, they create a lot of friendships, but also enemies. They make this game full of emotions. Spending together time, laughing and of course playing just this causes so many people to sit in front of the monitors. Good Clubs must be harmonized, they often search new players. In clubs is about twenty people. Some like each other, some others tolerate. Often there are misunderstandings, troubles and doubts, but more to make jokes, talk, and happily spend time. I could describe the whole game,, but in a few years players gets used to it and it doesn`t feel that way anymore. What's new all the time, it's just People. Regardless of how much time you spend in front of the TV, you will always find time to contract to play. <img class="foto_article" src="img/playroom.jpg" style="float:left"></img> As the last photo I gave Lobby in which spend the most time, because there i choosing position and waiting for searching game. They were unforgettable experiences, some bad ones, some good ones. At the end of my article, I would encourage everyone to try their strength in this thrilling mode. </p>
