				<h4>The Journey</h4>
				<p>Alex Hunter came to FIFA 17. Since then, many players follow his actions. As a Pro Clubs fan, played, won but I did not feel it. Maybe, if I played my character with Pro Clubs, I having another feelings. Alex`s ending your adventure in Fifa 19. It will be the only fictional character who got her own mode and became a star in 3 years. From Zero to Hero. In fifa 17, for the first time, we play this teenager. And it will depend on us, what will happen to him. We play a series of workouts and choose the first club. EA give us choose, we can playing all composition or only Alex`s. Which is inappropriate for me, because we play mode "The Journey" not "SEASON OFFLINE or ONLINE". We should play him. Between the games we have videos from the life of our future star. Every key decision has its consequences. Maybe this just attracts players, the story. It's like reading a good book, or watching a good movie, with one difference. You influence the star's actions. I will not describe what you may encounter in "The Journey". I will tell you, what are was my feeled... Who would not want to be Alex Hunter, hand to the top. No one? Exactly. EA has named Alex as the rising star, who is to go from point A to point B. Regardless of the results, the end is this same. As you go the way depends only on you. The mode itself is good, but not well developed, why? First of all, it quickly ends. This isn`t "Ultimate Team" or "Pro Clubs", where you play the whole fifa. You end up and go to FUT for Alex's card, which is so weak that you leave her with sentiment. Secondly, the final stop is set in advance. Thirdly, it is a video with the ability to control, not the reverse. The most lacking in this emotion. Everything too fast. A few matches and "the end". There is potential in this mode, but EA decided to abandon this mode, or as it prefers to quit. And fans should be honored with a moment of silence in the final scene in fifa 19.</p>
