				<h4>PS4</h4>
				<p>Console is full emotion. Describing the xbox I mentioned their advantages. Here, too, it would be nice to do it. Ps4 has more exclusive games, i.e. games in which only you play ps4. New VR technology that takes you to the world of games is very interesting. However, in order to be tempted, you have to spend a lot of cash. Just like on xbox, you need to buy the "Ps4 Plus" subscription to play online. In the case of this console, we have the opportunity to buy an account every month and spend a really small amount of money, and so we will get two games a month. And finally the pad is lighter, smaller and stronger. The pad is different to the left of the galley for control. After prolonged playing it does not cause problems, you should get used to it. I briefly described what the consoles offer. Now the PS4 scene itself. Here we have a choice of VPG, VFL, FVPA and a new creation of PLWK. All very well developed, have certain rules, we play four to six games a week. We have a bigger community here, that's why there are more clubs. There are the most streamers on PS4, because EA pays the most attention to this console. It creates the most tournaments, thanks to which you can earn a few money. On the market in "Ultimate Team" the case looks similar, you can see it by the number of auctions on the market. At present, this is the best choice if someone wants to spend the most time at fifa. </p>
