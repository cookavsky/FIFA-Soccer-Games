				<h4>Xbox One</h4>
				<p><img class="foto_article" src="img/xbox.jpg" style="float:left"></img>One of two consoles from to choose. A lot people have a problem with choose consoles. I had the same thing, so I outsmarted the system and bought both. The only variable, between console is pads. Pad from Xbox is heavier, but it stays in your hand better. When you buy subscription with name "Xbox Live", you can play over internet and you get two games in month. The biggest advantage of XBOX is Xbox Pass and EA Access. This is additional subscription for money, but you can play in games which they give you. PS4 have VR, XBOX have Kinect.<img class="foto_article" src="img/game_pass.jpg" style="float:right"></img>With a large room, you can have some fun with your friends. In this case, we don`t move pad, but hands. Kinect reads our movements and presents on xbox. It's a lot of games with this fun. And finally, it's worth mentioning backward compatibility, it allows you to play old games that have already appeared on the older generation of xbox. If I had to choose between consoles I would choose a PC, buy used console and left her for fifa. Maybe an explanation. Between the PC and Xbox 360 there was no such gap what is now. As long as it was xbox 360, xbox one is too weak. I have good television 4K and I need buy xbox for two thousand z≈Çotych to enjoy it. Adding the need to buy games that are 2x more expensive. Buying a computer for the rest of the games seems to be a better solution for me. Let's get to the topic. The xbox scene is developing all the time. More and more people, you can find a common game.<img class="foto_article" src="img/live.png" style="float:left">There are such scenes as VFL, VPL and FVPA. Unfortunately, the xbox stands out from each step of the PS4, has a smaller community, EA less on her draws attention and the founders of the scenes. It is a development race that wins xbox, because it always stays behind and PS4 shows him the way. At the end I can only write that on the xbox it is more convenient to communicate. Pads is better in the palm of your hand. People are younger, that's why they play more. If someone thinks that the community is different between consoles. It is in mistake, there will always be friendly and hostile people.</img><img class="foto_article" src="img/ea_access.jpg" style="float:right"></img> You play in "Ultimate Team, choose PS4. You have a better chance of hitting weak players, more players on the market, and being one of the best easier chance to appear on the net. I got used to the xbox, I got there full of knowledge and playing on PS4 I'm not as happy as I was on xbox.</p>
